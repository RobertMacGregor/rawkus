Using graphs to convert C/C++ to Rust.

This effort is exploratory.

Goals - answer these questions
* Can we create a measure of idiomatic code?
    * To what extent is code idiomatic?
* Can idiomatic Rust be generated from C code?
* Can idiomatic Rust be generated from C++ code?

* Can a graph db be used to capture parsed information from code?
   * What are the pros and cons of doing this?

* Given graphs of C code can machne learning be used to produce Rust code?
* Can we derive graph representations, of conversions, that can be rendered into code?

* Can our code-conversion give an inidcation of what can be converted and what cannot?
